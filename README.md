# Project Title

Vocal For Local - Talent Hunt


## Theme

Build a social media gathering app keeping "Vocal for Local" in mind which helps in promoting and helping non-privileged people who got a huge financial hit during lockdown

## Description
Here comes a new app for overcoming the needs of social interaction which vanished during lockdown , people locked themselves into there home with memories which they created before locking while travelling , sharing street food , gifting flowers to your loved ones or seeing the most talented street performers.
Lockdown just not only ruined the social interaction but also effected the one's who helped in creating sweet memories(the street food vendors and the rest street talents out there) .So now here we are with our app very much focused for creating memories and helping you to share  updated news regarding you and you friends again chilling and making memories with your favourite street performers (could be the musicians ,street food stalls , dancers , painters...) in your favourite areas . With this app we would help you to again start creating memories and with your post we love to help the street vendors and the rest street performers getting that old charm again
